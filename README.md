## How to install

-   `git clone git@github.com:MattMattC/cli-all.git` (me in my home)
-   `yarn install` or `npm install`
-   create you an alias in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` (where you want) `alias my-cli='node ~/cli-all/index.js'
-   refresh you're terminal or call you're `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`...
-   call the command `my-cli --help`
